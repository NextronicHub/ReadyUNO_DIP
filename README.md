# ReadyUNO_DIP
## Description
READY-UNO is the best board to start your personal electronics projects, it is built upon the famous ARDUINO UNO, so it shares its simplicity and its flexibility. It contains also a BreadBoard with different interfaces of communication (SPI, UART, I2C and Serial communication) for easy development.
The READY-UNO can be programmed over a Serial Communication, using the ARDUINO IDE.
The READY-UNO can be powered through the barrel jack. The on-board power regulator can handle anything from 7 to 15VDC.
